// Creating an Array: Define an array that stores product information for an e-commerce application. 
// Each element in the array should be a string containing product details, such as "Product Name - Price - Category - Availability."
let arr = [  "Product A - 1000 - Category 1 - In Stock",
                "Product B - 20000 - Category 2 - In Stock",
                "Product C - 15000 - Category 1 - Out of Stock",
                "Product D - 250- Category 2 - In Stock",]

// 2. Access and Display: Write code to access and display the details of a specific product from the array.
//  This demonstrates how arrays allow you to retrieve and display information efficiently.
let i = userInput = prompt("Enter the index:");
console.log(arr[i]);

// 3. Adding Products: Add new products to the array by pushing new strings. 
// Show how arrays are dynamic and how products can be inserted into the array as new items become available.

arr.push["Product E - 350- Category 1 - Out of Stock"];

// 4. Removing Products: Remove discontinued products from the array using the `splice()` method.
//  This illustrates how arrays help in managing changes in the product catalog.
